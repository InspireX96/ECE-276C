## Run the codes
To run code for question 1:

```bash
python p1_main.py
```

To run code for question 2:

```bash
python p2_main.py
```

Note that to change track for question 2, you need to modify the comment in *line 74-76* in `p2_main.py`:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # TODO: select track here
    # track = "FigureEight"
    # track = "Linear"
    track = "Circle"
```

## Tests

To test the codes, do `cd tests/` and run `pytest`
